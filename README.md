# EECS504 Final Project: Human Gesture Recognition Through Skeleton Estimation
## Overview
we proposed a vision-based explicit method that calculated the probability distribution of human intentions through gesture recognition for autonomous vehicles. The method utilizes a human skeleton estimation model to find the locations of the human skeleton key points, and constructs a feature vector to represent the human gesture based on the estimated human skeleton key points. A gesture recognition model is further deployed to obtain the human intention probability distribution with feature vectors as the inputs.

The human skeleton estimation is following this [CVPR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08050).
